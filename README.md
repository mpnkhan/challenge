# Challenges or Games
=========
Quizes and Competition helps accessibility advocates to motivate people to take part in Accessibility sessions and events. 
In a typical booth setup, this would help to attract more folks.
There could be many competitions and I'm here throwing a few ideas. Please feel free to add more ideas..

## Identifying problems in a bad website
Created this website with many accessibility barriers, which a web designer or developer would normally code. The one who identifies the most number of problems would get a goodie.

## Identifying icons without labels
This is a game created to test how many icons does people can identify if there are no alternate labels
Users were shown an icon and then four label options below, of which only one was the correct answer. There were 19 icons in total, and all the icons were taken from popular iOS apps
